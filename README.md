# tools-of-the-trade
A repository for my python and excell based tools to keep track of trades in a game called entropia universe. to us ethis you will need a few prequisits.
You'l the newest pyhton release instaled to your computer you will be using this on, to get this go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ then download and
install the newest version of python, this may require you too reboot your computer to finish, do this before atemting the next step. Next you will need to
open a terminal/comand promt, on windows you do this by going to the search section on the task bar, click it to do a search and type in cmd and hit enter. 
This should open a comand prompt, click on it and type the following command: pip install openpyxl 
If this causes pip to complain ie error out, just add the neccesary flags it tells you too to the end of the previous command, for example it might ask for
the --user flag, to add this type: pip install openpyxl --user
Once you ahve these installed your ready to use the scripts, but you will need a program to open spreadsheets with on your computer, if you dont have an MS
office 365 subsription, which most people dont, you can go to https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/?lang=en-US&version=7.1.4&pk_campaign=update
and download the newest version of libre office, a free and open source alternative to MS office. Once this is done your ready to use this tool. Too use
it download hte code from this github page and uzip it to the area you will use it in and youre all setup. From here to add or remove items on the spreadsheet
go to where you unzipped the tool using a file manager and find the file called transaction.py , next left click this file once so its highlighted, now 
rightclick it and find the open with option in the list and click it. Next you will see a menu of programs appear to its right ot left, at the bottom select the choose another
app option. This should open a larger menu, find the option called python or something simmiliar and selecte it, then before pressing ok tick the box that says
always use this app to open .py files, or something simmiliar then hit ok. this may or may not open a comand prompt with the script running. It doesnt matter 
because now file manager is setup so that you dont have to go through that whole previous menu ordeal, simply left click the transaction.py file twice and it 
should open. From here the script is pretty self explanatory, but if there are ever updated to the script you may have to delete the transaction.py file and 
replace it with teh new ne from this gitub, this wont delete your data because its all stored in the spreadsheet file. Finally when you open the spreadsheet
file with libre office it may ask you to safe the spreadsheet in a different file formate, DO NOT DO THIS it will make the file inaccesable to the python script
When this popup apears there should be a tick box on it to not remind you again, tick this before closing the popup.
